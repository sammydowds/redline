title: Media Consolidation
---

The hottest product in tech is Bluesky, adding 1 million users a day since the election. CEO Jay Graber says the platform will never have ads, as ads are the road to "enshittification". OK then. Ad-supported media, as a whole, is one of the least volatile businesses over the last century - accounting for 1.5% of GDP, and rarely straying from that number. Inside the sector, things are less tranquil (i.e., more chaotic). In an attention economy, money follows eyeballs. I believe we'll see ads on Bluesky eventually, but for now, let's talk about consolidation in the broader sector.&#x20;

## Burmese Pythons

Stories about Burmese pythons litter the local news in Florida. These snakes get big, really big. The serpents can grow to as much as 16 feet long and weigh hundreds of pounds. This presents a problem, as most owners are 5 foot 9 and soon discover their roommate situation is unworkable. Owners release the snakes into the Everglades, where they begin taking down alligators and deer. An alien species to the ecosystem of swamps, marshes, and mangrove forests, they've established themselves as the apex predator, and their population exploded. The threat to Florida's ecosystem is so great that mitigation efforts include employing full-time snake hunters and organizing state-sponsored hunting competitions. The winner of one competition earned $10, 000 for nabbing 28 pythons - a drop in the bucket against a species that lay 30-plus eggs at a time and can reproduce asexually. After three decades, the U.S. Geological Survey concluded in 2023 that the python is winning.

Unlike the classic apex predator, which evolves alongside its prey, a nonnative apex predator arrives with such a disruptive force that instead of dominating an ecosystem they transform it. Legacy media looks like Florida 30 years after the arrival of the Burmese python. A nonnative apex predator (digital) is out-hunting and out-reproducing the previous apex predator (legacy media).

## Winner Take Most

Digitization lowers the barrier to entry, giving everyone access to everything. Initially, this looks like competition with extra protein, but over time it becomes consolidation on steriods, as digital ecosystems are winner-take-most/all based on who establishes leadership and access to the cheapest capital. Amazon registers 37% of e-commerce in the U.S., while its nine closes competitors (Walmart, Apple, Target, etc.) account for 23% combined.&#x20;
